## The Games:
* OneDay: During the night, your cards are stolen, swapped, carefully inspected and drunkenly taken by accident.
It's up to you to piece together the truth (if you're a townie) or bluff your way to victory (if you're an evil werewolf),
in the Trial, where you'll be voting to kill the werewolves among you. For 3-7 players.

* Classic: A classic game of werewolf lasting multiple nights. Featuring werewolves, doctors, cops and vigilantes.

* Mafia execution, Mission games haven't been started yet: maybe you could help write them?

I want to avoid confusion between the OpenWerewolf site that I run and the sites that others may run.
Therefore "OpenWerewolf" is an unregistered trademark belonging to me, James Craster.
I ask that you call forked versions of OpenWerewolf by a different name, and that you call your websites by a different name.
